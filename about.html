  <h1>About the Memory Game</h1>

  <p>This game is a classic 4x4 memory matching game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Your goal is to match all pairs of NBA player cards as fast as possible. The timer tracks how quickly you complete the game, and your best time is saved locally on your device.</p>
  <p>You can restart the game at any time, and the timer will start only when you flip the first card.</p>
